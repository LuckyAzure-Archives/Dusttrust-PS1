# Dusttrust PS1  
An unofficial **Dusttrust** remake for the original PlayStation.  

This project was initially created as an experiment to implement the engine on the PS1, but it was left unfinished due to heavy hardcoding and limitations in my earlier knowledge. It is more of a modification of **PSXFunkin**, using various files and scripts from the community.  

This project was made back when **Nickolas owned Dusttrust**.  

## Credits  
- **Dustswap: DUSTTRUST** is owned by **DillyWolf**  
- **Logo and all the music |** Nickolas
- **Terrible menu artwork & battle sprite |** Made by me

### Tools Used
